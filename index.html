                        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure 
                        itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
                        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires 
                        to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil 
                        and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes 
                        laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault 
                        with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that 
                        produces no resultant pleasure?"
